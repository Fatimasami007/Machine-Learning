# Comprehensive Toolkit: Preprocessing, Machine Learning, and Differential Gene Expression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code implementations for data preprocessing pipelines, machine learning algorithms, and differential gene expression analysis. It is designed to provide easy-to-follow scripts for various stages of data analysis, from raw data preprocessing to advanced model implementation and interpretation of results.

## Repository Contents
### 1. Machine Learning Algorithms
- Implementation of classification and regression models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Multilayer Perceptron

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Scripts for handling raw data, including:
  - Label encoding and scaling
  - Splitting data into training and testing sets
  - Feature standardization and normalization
- Includes preprocessing for datasets like Parkinson's Disease and other labeled datasets.

### 3. Differential Gene Expression Analysis
- Analysis of gene expression data to identify significant genes.
- Statistical methods include:
  - Fold Change Calculation
  - p-value adjustment (e.g., Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction)
- Tools and packages: `DESeq2`.
